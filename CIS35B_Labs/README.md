# CIS35B: Advanced Java Programming - All Labs
This repository contains all the labs assigned during De Anza College's CIS35B Spring 2015 course. We students were to continuously build upon previous lab assignments in this course such that each successive lab added to one quarter-long project. The end result is an application that can be described as similar to something like <a href="http://www.kbb.com/">KBB.com</a>, a " vehicle valuation and automotive research company" as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Blue_Book">Wikipedia</a> puts it.

This course puts emphasis on foundation technologies in Java for writing server side programs. Concepts include inner classes, collections, exceptions, file I/O, reflections, cloning, swing, multi-threading and JavaBeans.

## Course Objectives (from syllabus)
- Write Java programs using complete syntactical features, including inner classes.
- Use the data structures and algorithms in the collections introduced in JAVA 2.
- Design and create run time and checked exceptions to support the error recovery needed for robust programming.
- Use the complete range of advanced I/O features offered by Java.
- Use reflection features of Java to determine object information at run time.
- Create classes which support the ability to be cloned.
- Program thread-safe applications using Collections and Swing
- Use the JavaBean component architecture to build Beans and graphical tools to construct applications.
- Use the Swing API to program fullÂ­featured GUI applications.
