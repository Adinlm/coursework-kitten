# CS149 PERL Programming: Final Project
This repository contains the final lab assigned during Ohlone College's CS149 course for Winter 2015. The task for this final project was to add code to the base program which would allow a system admin to design their own view of the database by allowing selection of which fields to print.

Unfortunately, there is no online preview for the finished lab as the project was hosted in-course on a private server and this repository does not contain its own server.

## Background
Ohlone's Multimedia Festival, which runs every Spring, has been using a program, mostly written by students from the PERL class, over the years. There has been a request from those running the festival to make available an option to allow the system admin choosing what fields are displayed on the screen. Right now, all the fields show up under the options 'Generic list of projects (show all)' and 'Sort and view all records', except for one option, called 'Simple View', which only shows 4 fields.
