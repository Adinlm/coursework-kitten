-----

----- A number of business rules that apply to the EMPLOYEES and DEPARTMENTS
----- tables are listed below. Decide how to implement each of these business
----- rules, by means of declarative constraints or by using triggers. Which
----- constraints or triggers are needed and are there any problems to be
----- expected? Implement the business rules by defining the triggers or
----- constraints that you decided to create. A partial package is provided in
----- file lab17_1.sql to which you should add any necessary procedures or
----- functions that are to be called from triggers that you may create for the
----- following rules. (The triggers should execute procedures or functions
----- that you have defined in the package.)
