-----

----- Suppose you have lost the code for the NEW_EMP procedure and the
----- VALID_DEPTID function that you created in lesson 10. (If you did not
----- complete the practices in lesson 10, you can run the solution scripts to
----- create the procedure and function.) Create an iSQL*Plus spool file to
----- query the appropriate data dictionary view to regenerate the code.
--- Hint:
--- SET -- options ON|OFF
--- SELECT -- statement(s) to extract the code
--- SET -- reset options ON|OFF
----- To spool the output of the file to a .sql file from iSQL*Plus, select the
----- Save option for the Output and execute the code.
