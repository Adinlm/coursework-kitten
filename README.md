# CIS29-Lab4-Graphs-LambdaExpressions
CIS29 Spring Quarter 2015 - Lab 4, Graphs and Lambda Expressions

## Purpose
Use Graphs, Inheritance, Lambda expressions and Threading

### Part 1
Design a graph program with nodes and edges to handle the data in the Coordinates.xml file.  Use the data to create a weighted graph.

### Part 2
Add a member function to produce a Minimal Spanning Tree using any of the Dykstra, Kruskal or Prim algorithms.  

### Part 3
Launch the Minimal Spanning algorithm defined in part 2 and display the MST.
