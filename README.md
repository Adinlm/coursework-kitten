This repository contains work from various courses I have taken in the past. Each directory at the top level contains work from a single course and all work from a single course (usually) used to be in its own git repository before being merged to this one.

## Course List
While the table below briefly lists information about what each course directory contains, more in-depth descriptions about each course can be found by simply viewing the `README.md` in each course directory.

Courses are sorted by Year and Season:

## Other things
**Why the kitten?**  
Because kittens.

**Can I use your work for my own homework?**  
Um. No. See the following question.

**Why do you post your coursework up if you're not letting anyone use it?**  
I sometimes reference my previous work when I forget something. Anyone can do the same and and also use it. Heck, you could use this work without attribution if you'd like. However, despite being unable to enforce it, I do not allow for you to use this work to *cheat* on your homework. Just don't do it. It's for your own good and chances are you'll get caught anyway.

**Do your instructors know that you've posted course materials online?**  
Yes. I make it a point, out of respect, to ask for permission from the course instructor before posting any of my coursework online.

**Why the kitten???**  
Because kittens.
