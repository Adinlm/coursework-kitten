# CS149-perl-final-project
CS149 Winter Semester 2015 - Final Project
## Background
Ohlone's Multimedia Festival, which runs every Spring, has been using a program, mostly written by students from the perl class, over the years. There has been a request from those running the festival to make available an option to allow the system admin choosing what fields are displayed on the screen. Right now, all the fields show up under the options 'Generic list of projects (show all)' and 'Sort and view all records', except for one option, called 'Simple View', which only shows 4 fields.

The task for this final project is to add code to this program, which will allow
a system admin to design their own view of the database by allowing selecting
which fields will print.
