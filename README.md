# CIS35B-Labs
Spring 2015 CIS 35B: Advanced Java - Lab Assignments
## Description
This repository holds the lab assignments for the CIS35B Advanced Java course at De Anza College. We students are to continuously build upon previous lab assignments in this course such that each successive lab adds to one quarter-long project. The end result is an application that can be described as similar to something like <a href="http://www.kbb.com/">KBB.com</a>, a " vehicle valuation and automotive research company" as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Blue_Book">Wikipedia</a> puts it.
