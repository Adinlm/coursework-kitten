        Salutations, the name's Wolfgang Christian. Those two names make up my first name but I often shorten it to Wolfgang C. and I prefer to go by Wolfgang.<br>
        <br>
        The long story short as of <b>when I wrote this (Fall 2015)</b>: in and out of computer science and software engineering, I have a passion for learning. While I currently specialize in full stack web development, I do plan to broaden my knowledge in many of the sub-fields of CS and software engineering in the future&ndash;particularly in AI, parallel computing, and cyber security&ndash;as well as in other fields I have or develop major interests in.<br>
        <br>
        ----------<br>
        <br>
        Building on all of the above, I am a Computer Science Major currently attending both De Anza College and Ohlone College full-time; education is one of my top priorities. One of my biggest goals in education presently is to transfer to a four-year university, specifically UC Berkeley. On the other side of the learning spectrum, I also tutor Computer Science and programming at De Anza College, something I actually find quite enjoyable for the most part since I can pass on all the cool things I have learned or will learn.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, while I'm on the subject of learning, I often receive comments from others basically telling me I am a learning junkie. Plenty of my free time is spent in my pursuit of knowledge, which is not limited to computer science. To list just a few of my current favorites outside of CS, I also study Japanese and German, social psychology, and neuroscience.<br>
